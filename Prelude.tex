 \section{Executive Summary} 

In a world that is dynamic in almost every aspect, mobility is a necessity.  However, for persons that suffer from disabilities, their mobility can be severely limited.  Traveling with limited mobility can be a very difficult and burdening task, especially if it involves being within the small confines of an airplane.  Passengers that are faced with limited mobility or a disability have a different and often times worse experience than the average passenger throughout the entire flight experience.  How can we give all passengers the same experience? Creating a new travel system are essential for giving the same experience to all passengers and to give passengers with limited mobilitythe independence and control they lack today.

Embraer, the Brazilian airline manufacturer, decided to partner with Stanford University and the University of Sao Paulo to solve the problem of improving the entire air travel experience for persons with limited mobility. In collaboration, we started this journey toward a solution through extensive needfinding and benchmarking. The needfinding centered on conducting user interviews for both the disabled passenger and the flight crew, while benchmarking focused on analyzing analogous situations, patents, regulations, and current concepts and solutions in place today.

The research that was conducted during needfinding and benchmarking was instrumental in the approach we are taking toward a solution. The user interviews led us to the four themes we need to address with our solution. These themes are improving customer service, giving the user control and independence, and creating a non-discriminatory solution. The interviews with potential users revealed horror stories that dealt with customer service or the lack thereof. The solution space needs to create an environment that limits or improves the quality of the interactions between the flight crew and the passenger to prevent these horror stories from becoming a reality for future travelers. Independence and control were also instrumental in our findings. The users of our solution want to feel independent and in control of their situation even when they might need assistance. This leads our solution path to one that provides piece of mind to our user. Because wheelchairs often gets damaged when they are handled from the jet way to the cargo hold, wheelchair users are very anxious and spend their flight wondering if  their mobility device will make it safely to their destination. Finally, we realized that since passengers with disabilities have a condition that singles them out, we should focus on creating a product that is well designed with the user in mind and that lacks the dehumaninzing aspects that we see in cabin mobility aids today.

These themes were our driving forces for the critical function and critical experience prototypes we created to further explore our problem space. The team created a number of prototypes but really focused on the ones that solved this problem; one being a more incremental fix while the other addressed a more futuristic solutions. 

Our vision is to provide the wheelchair user with two products that address the main themes and the biggest painpoints. As mobility inside the cabin is an extremely uncomfortable and unsafe experience today, we want to give passengers a completely redesigned aisle chair that allows for improved customer service as well as increased passenger comfort and support. No longer do passengers need to be carried by airport personnel and risk injury since this redesigned aisle chair will allow the user to move inside the cabin and transfer independently from one seat to the next using either the lateral or frontal transfer options.  Having access to a more humane and versatile aisle chair will certainly revolutionize the flying experience for wheelchair users.

Beyond solving mobility inside the cabin, airport logistics concerning wheelchair storage must also be improved. It doesn't matter how delightful the flight experience was if a disabled passenger can't move once they arrive at their destination because their wheelchair is broken. We found that most of the damage to wheelchairs is incurred during the handling process so we have created a platform that allows handlers to manipulate any type of wheelchair, whether it's powered or manual, without having to touch the wheelchair itself. We are also using smart features that know who is responsible for the wheelchair and can detect any signs of mishandling. With this, we aim to reduce the number of damaged wheelchairs and improve the handing experience for airport personnel. 

We know that in order to provide wheelchair users with an enjoyable flying experience from beginning to end, our solution must provide them with absolute piece of mind concerning what happens to their mobility device when it is taken away from them and  a pleasant cabin experience that makes them feel independent, in control and not singled out. Both improvements, shown in Figure ref{fig:exec}  are necessary to truly redesigning the flying experience for people with reduced mobility.

% Set up the Glossary. The template is looking for a file called

% You can either edit this file manually or you
% can use the Memoir glossary feature in which you insert items like
%   \glossary{glossary term}{our definition of what the term means}
% wherever you like, as you write your documentation.
% When you run the report through Latex, it will create a ".glo" file like
% "OurFallDocument.glo" which you can edit to create the file "glossaryterms.tex"
% There is also perl script I made which will do the formatting for you.
