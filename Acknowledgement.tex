\chapter{Acknowledgement}

We would like to start by thanking our sponsor, Embraer, without whom this project never would have occurred. We're grateful for the challenge you've provided us as well as the support along the way (and the awesome factory tour!).

Additionally, we would like to thank Zodiac for their generocity in loaning us three sets of airplane seats for use at EXPE.

The teaching teams on both campuses have also been enormously supportive of our team, especially when making our most difficult decisions. We would like to thank our Stanford faculty and staff, Larry, Mark, and George, as well as John, Jo, and Manny for administrative support, our USP faculty, including Eduardo and Andrew, and our TAs, Steph, Dan, Adi, Scott, Maria Alice, and Yanaze.

Our coaches, Annika and Shelly, have also been very helpful and supportive through the entire process. Annika especially has made herself available to help us on an almost weekly basis to support both our design decisions and other challenges.


Finally, we'd like to thank Riley for his assistance in providing consulting on mechanical design and assistance in the manufacturing process.
